    <h1>Bank System Application, BigReal Program, and Problem Solving Using OOP</h1>
    <p>This repository contains code for the Bank System Application, BigReal Program, and Problem Solving using OOP. The Bank System Application is a software system designed for use by banks to manage customer accounts, transactions, and other banking operations. The BigReal Program is a C++ class that allows for the representation of real numbers with an unlimited number of digits and provides supporting math functions. The Problem Solving Using OOP component includes sample code that demonstrates how to solve various problems using object-oriented programming techniques.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Bank System Application, BigReal Program, and Problem Solving Using OOP are three software projects that demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming techniques in solving various problems. The Bank System Application is designed to help banks manage customer accounts, transactions, and other banking operations. The BigReal Program is a C++ class that allows for the representation of real numbers with an unlimited number of digits and provides supporting math functions. Problem Solving Using OOP includes sample code that demonstrates how to solve various problems using object-oriented programming techniques.</p>
    <p>This repository contains the source code, documentation, and tests for all three projects, as well as information on how to install, configure, and use the software.</p>
    <h2>Bank System Application</h2>
    <p>The Bank System Application includes a range of features and functionalities, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Management of customer accounts and transactions</li>
      <li>Secure authentication and access control mechanisms</li>
      <li>User-friendly interfaces for managing banking operations</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>BigReal Program</h2>
    <p>The BigReal Program is a C++ class that allows for the representation of real numbers with an unlimited number of digits and provides supporting math functions. The class makes use of the BigDecimalInt class through OOP composition. The BigDecimalInt class provides the necessary support for storing and manipulating integers with an unlimited number of digits, which the BigReal class uses to represent the integral and fractional parts of a real number. The BigReal class provides math functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division that operate on the real numbers it represents. These functions make use of the supporting math functions of the BigDecimalInt class to perform the necessary arithmetic operations. Using OOP composition allows the BigReal class to take advantage of the capabilities of the BigDecimalInt class without having to reimplement them. This makes the implementation of the BigReal class simpler, more efficient, and easier to maintain.</p>
    <h2>Problem Solving Using OOP</h2>
    <p>Problem Solving Using OOP includes sample code that demonstrates how to solve various problems using object-oriented programming techniques. Some of the problems solved include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functions Solver</li>
      <li>Documents Similarity</li>
      <li>Label Generator</li>
      <li>Game of life</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
    <p>To install and use the Bank System Application, BigReal Program, or Problem Solving Using OOP, please follow the instructions provided in the documentation located in the <code>docs/</code> directory. The documentation includes information on how to install and configure the software for your system, as well as how to use the various features and functions of the software.</p>
